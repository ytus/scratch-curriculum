#Fish Chomp

__Introduction:__
We’re going to make a Fish Chomp game! Guide the large Hungry Fish and try to eat all the prey that are swimming around.

##STEP 1: Create a sprite that changes costumes
__Let’s make the Hungry Fish swim around the sea!__

1. Start a new Scratch project.
2. Select the Stage, then select the Stage’s Background tab. Import the
background nature/underwater and remove background1.
3. Change the name of Sprite 1 to Hungry Fish.
4. Import Hungry Fish’s costume, resources/hungry-fish then remove its existing costume1 and costume2.
5 Use the button above the Costumes tab to make sure the sprite can only flip left-right.
6. Now create a script for Hungry Fish to follow the mouse around the sea like this:

```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever		
		point towards mouse-pointer
		move 3 steps
	(end forever)
```

###Test Your Project
__Click the green flag.__ 
Move the mouse pointer around the sea. Does the fish follow the pointer?
What happens if you don’t move the mouse pointer and the fish catches up with it? What does it look like? Why does it do this?


7. You can stop the Hungry Fish flipping like crazy if you make it only move when it’s not too near the mouse pointer
(The _distance to_ block is in the
Sensing palette).


```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever	if distance to mouse-pointer > 10
		point towards mouse-pointer
		move 3 steps
	(end forever)
```


###Test Your Project

Save your project

##Things to try

If you want, you can put different numbers in the script. How does that change how Hungry Fish moves? Change the distance threshold to a large number (e.g. 100), or a small number (e.g. 1). Change the amount the fish moves to a large number (e.g. 20) or a small number (e.g. 1 or even 0).


##STEP 2: Add some prey

1. Create a new sprite from the file animals/lobster1. 
2. Use the Shrink sprite tool (above the Stage)
to make the sprite smaller.
3. Create a script to make the prey swim around. We want them to move randomly, so let’s make it move forward a bit, then turn a random amount left or right, then do it again

```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever		
		move 2 steps
		turn pick random -20 to 20 degrees
		if on edge, bounce
	(end forever)
```

###Test Your Project
__Click the green flag__ and watch the prey swim around. Does it swim like you expect? Does it swim realistically?

__At the moment, the Hungry Fish and the prey don’t interact with each other. We’ll sort that out in the next step.__

Save your project

###Things to try

* Try changing the numbers in the pick random and move blocks. How do they make the prey move differently?
* What does the __if on edge, bounce__ block do? Take it out and see what happens.

##STEP 3: Hungry fish eats the prey

__Now we want to make the Hungry Fish eat the prey!__ Once the Hungry Fish has caught the prey in its mouth, two things need to happen:
* The Hungry Fish needs to close its mouth and make a "chomp" sound.
* The prey needs to disappear, then reappear a short while later.

1. First, let’s make the prey disappear if it is touching the hungry fish, and then reappear 3 seconds later. Use the touching block to see if it is touching the fish.

```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever		
		move 2 steps
		turn pick random -20 to 20 degrees
		if on edge, bounce
		if touching Hungry Fish?
			hide
			wait 3 secs
			show
		(end if)
	(end forever)
```

###Test Your Project
__Try out your game again – can you spot any problems?__ Notice that the prey disappears no matter where it touches the hungry fish. Also, the fish could just wait 3 seconds and eat the prey the moment it reappears – this isn’t very fair!

2. How could we make sure the prey only disappears if it is touching the hungry fish’s mouth? Well, we could use the touching color block, and see if it is touching the fish’s blue teeth. To do this, replace the touching block with a
touching color block in your script, click on the color in the block and then click again on the fish’s teeth.
3. Next we can make the prey move to a random point on the screen before reappearing using a go to
block, and giving it a random
value for x and y.

```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever		
		move 2 steps
		turn pick random -20 to 20 degrees
		if on edge, bounce
		if touching colour []?
			hide
			wait 3 secs
			go to x:random -220 to 220 y: pick random -170 to 170
			show
		(end if)
	(end forever)
```
###Test your project

Try the game again – does the prey only vanish when it touches the fish’s mouth? And does it re-appear in a random point on the screen instead of where it was eaten?

4. The fish needs to know when it has eaten something so it can play a sound and change its skin. To do this, we can have the prey broadcast the fact that it’s been eaten before vanishing.

```scratch

	when FLAG clicked
	forever		
		move 2 steps
		turn pick random -20 to 20 degrees
		if on edge, bounce
		if touching colour []?
			broadcast got me
			hide
			wait 3 secs
			go to x:random -220 to 220 y: pick random -170 to 170
			show
		(end if)
	(end forever)
```
__Now we want the fish to respond
to this message by making a “chomp” sound and snapping its jaws.__

5. Add the resources/mouth-closed costume and the resources/chomp sound to the Hungry Fish sprite.
6. Then, add a new script to the Hungry Fish to respond to the message broadcast by the prey. This script should make the fish play the 'chomp' sound and switch to the mouth-closed costume, wait briefly and then switch back.

```scratch

	when I receive got me
	play sound chomp
	repeat 2
		switch to costume mouth-closed
		wait 0.5 secs
		switch to costume hungry-fish
	(end repeat)
```

__Now our Hungry Fish is ready to eat, let’s fill the ocean with prey. Right-click on the prey sprite and click “duplicate” several times.__

###Test Your Project
Click the green flag.
Does the Hungry Fish eat the prey? Does it eat each of the different prey?

Save your project

###Things to think about
Why do we need to add the show block to the start of the prey’s script? Think about what would happen if the prey is eaten, then the game is stopped before it reappears. What would happen if the game was restarted then?

__Well done you’ve finished the basic game. There are more things you can do to your game though. Are you ready for a challenge?__


##Challenge 1: Make the prey move differently

At the moment, all the prey move in the same way. __Can you make one of them
move differently?__
__Hint:__ Don’t spend too long on this bit without looking at the other activities in this
project.

__Pick one of the prey to experiment on.__ If they have the same costumes, make it a different colour with the __set color effect block__. That way, you can tell it apart from the rest of the prey.

Make this prey move slower than the others. __Hint:__ Look at the move (2) steps block.


###Test Your Project
Does the prey move slower? Does this make the game better?
If you can do that, __try to making one of fish move quicker than the others.__


Does the prey still move in a sensible way? Do these changes make the game better?
__Hint:__ If your prey swims around in circles, check the values of the pick random block in the turn block.

How about you make each of the prey behave differently, using different combinations of these changes?

Do any of these changes make the game better? Do they make the game more interesting, more fun, harder, or easier? Are any of those “better”?

Save your project

##Challenge 2: Make the prey avoid the hungry fish

The prey in this game are really stupid! They just swim around randomly until they’re eaten. Real fish swim away from predators. __Let’s make one of the prey swim away from the Hungry Fish.__

There’s no block in Scratch that tells you the direction that another sprite is in. But you can make one sprite point towards another, then make it turn around to face away. The blocks you need are in the __Motion__ palette.

Using that idea, __make one of the prey always point away from the Hungry Fish.__ You might want to make it wiggle as it swims away.

###Test Your Project
Does this make the fish harder to catch? Does it make the game better?

Save your project

##Challenge 3: Add a score
It’s not enough just to eat fish. How do you know you’re better at the game than your
friends? __You need a way to keep score so lets add a score board.__ Look at the __Keep Score scratch card__ for an idea of how to do it. 

Where should you put the block that changes the score?

Make sure the score goes back to zero at the start of the game. Where should you put that block?

###Test Your Project
Does the score go to zero at the start of the game? Does it go up every time you eat prey?

Save your project

##Challenge 4: Add a countdown

__Give yourself a time limit in the game.__ How many fish can you eat in thirty
seconds?

Look at the __Timer scratch card__ for how to add a timer to the game. Start with the game lasting thirty seconds.

###Test Your Project
Does the timer start at 30?

Does it go down at the right speed?

Can you catch prey while the timer is going?

Does the game stop when the timer reaches zero?

Save your project

##Challenge 5: Add a bonus score
Award a large bonus score if you can eat all three fish at the same time. How can
you tell how many fish have been eaten?
__Hint:__ One way to do this __uses a variable to count how many prey are swimming around.__

Save your project

##Challenge 6: Change the game: keep a prey alive! Sometimes, you can have great new ideas by taking an existing idea and doing the opposite.

__Modify the game so that, instead of you controlling a fish that tries to eat the others, you control one prey in a sea with lots of Hungry Fish.__ How long can you last before you’re eaten?
